## Problem Scenario: Small Load

Marjan only wants to transport 10 m³ of logs.

### If he orders transport:

- He is wasting money  
- He is causing issues for the driver  
- Profit is reduced  

### If he waits for more trees to be cut down:

- The wood might degrade  
- Storage space is wasted  

### Alternative with LagerSync

- The system automatically finds nearby drivers who aren’t driving full trucks  
- He adds his load to others  
- Marjan doesn’t waste money on a whole truck  
- He can have logs transported at any time without worry

## Problem Scenario: Wish for Documentation

Marjan wants to keep documentation of previous transports.

### If he does it manually:

- He loses valuable time that could be spent elsewhere  
- He needs to manually input all details  
- Paperwork and transport documentation become messy  

### If he doesn’t do it:

- He might forget important details  
- He might lose driver information  

### Alternative with LagerSync

- All details of previous orders are saved in the app  
- Documentation is easily accessible  
- Marjan doesn’t lose time writing down details
