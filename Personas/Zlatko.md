## Lifestyle

Zlatko is a 27-year-old shipper employed by SIDG. He is single and drives to logging sites daily from Ribnica. He has been working for SIDG for about 4 years now and he has worked there since he got out of college.

He is constantly under pressure from supperiors, since he has to constantly deliver more and more logs to the sawmills, and because the ZGS does not allow clear-cutting, he has to reach out to private forest owners, if they would be willing to sell their land to SIDG. When the trucks are half full, he has to hear from supperiors, and is under a lot of stress.

He has to stay late a lot, since he has to wait for logging trucks to get to the logging site and finish loading.

Zlatko wants a simple system so that he can come into work, do his job and clock out as soon as possible.

In his free time, he likes hiking and meeting new people.

**Values:**
- Simplicity   
- Easy communication  
- Practical solutions 
- Free time
- Money

Prefers digital tools that save time rather than complicated systems.

### Problem Scenario: Missing Truck

Zlatko has arranged to have 32 m³ of logs picked up by a private contractor, but he has been waiting for 30 minutes now, and the truck driver has not showed up yet, despite calling him.

If he continues waiting:
- He could be just standing there for hours, with no additional pay, and the truck might not even show up.
- If the truck shows up, the truck driver can always say that for instance 8m³ of logs are not a high enough grade, and that he wont be loading cellulose.
- 1/4 of the day is wasted.

If he goes home:
- He will hear from both his supperiors and the truck driver if the truck showed up.


#### Alternative with LagerSync
- The system automatically displays the driver location so he can estimate how soon the truck will show up, this way if he sees the truck standing in the same spot for a long time he can guess that the driver got a flat tire or is getting weighed by the police.
- Since he sees the location of the truck driver, he can also just drive there if it is close by, if he can not get ahold of the driver.
