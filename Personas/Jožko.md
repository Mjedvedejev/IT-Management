## 💬 Quote

> "If my truck isn’t full, I’m losing money. I just need clear routes, ready logs, and no surprises."

### Problem Scenario: Partial Truck Load

Jožko receives a transport order from a private forest owner with only 14 m³ of logs.  
A full truck holds 32 m³.

If he accepts:
- He drives with a half-empty truck.
- Fuel costs stay the same.
- Profit is reduced.

If he refuses:
- He risks losing future cooperation.
- The forest owner must wait longer for transport.

#### Alternative with LagerSync
- The system automatically finds nearby timber from SIDG or another private owner.
- Loads are combined to reach full capacity.
- Jožko receives an optimized route.
- Truck is fully loaded → maximum profitability.

### Problem Scenario: Last-Minute Cancellation

Jožko drives 40 km to a pickup location.  
When he arrives, the logs are not ready or the forest road is too muddy after rain.

Consequences:
- Wasted fuel
- Lost working hours
- Delayed schedule
- Reduced daily income

#### Alternative with LagerSync
- Forest owners must confirm readiness before pickup.
- Jožko receives real-time notifications.
- He can postpone or reassign the route digitally.

Result:
- Fewer unnecessary trips
- Better time management
- More predictable income
