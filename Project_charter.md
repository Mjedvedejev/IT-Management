## The importance of the project for the organization and its environment
Less complications for truck drivers, quicker lumber transport, syncronisation and communication between private forest owners

## The purpose and the objectives of the project
Purpose:
* Easier lumber transport organisation
* Less empty trucks -> less emmitions
* cooperation between private forest owners and the country.

Goal:
Create a web application, which would allow private owners of forests or SIDG, to sign up that they have a certain number of logs that need transport, (these would be less than a full truck), the application would then organise this in such a way so that the truck driver would just go from one pile to the other, thus fully filling up his truck, so that it can then be transported to sawmills or abroad, where they are usually sold .This way, the private forest owners and SIDG would get transportation for their lumber.

## Possible requirements of the contracting authority (options):
* Other rules of the organisation:
In the situation of a combined transport of lumber (from both the private owner and SIDG), SIDG chooses where these logs will be sold and in the end SIDG pays out the private owner without taking an additional organisational cut.
* Spatial and working conditions:
In the case of rain, or other unfavorable weather conditions that do not allow the transport of logs, the trucker is given the option to either postpone or cancel the transportation.
* Description of the finished product, service or result:
Web application for synchronization of private land owners and transportation of logs, and further support of the project
* Reporting and final report:
In the end both ZGS and SIDG get the financial report and the final report. Also additional tools are enabled so that they can report problems in the application and comunicate with the developers.
